# The Post/Comments WebApp

This is a simple WebApp that displays a list of Posts retrieved from a Mockup Backend by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com). The comments of each Post is displayed when the "Show Comments" button is pressed.

Most of the code changes are in the "src/components" folder. Other files are auto generated by [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

- src/components/comments.js
- src/components/post.js
- src/components/posts.js
- src/App.js

Styling was done with [Materialize CSS](https://materializecss.com/)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
